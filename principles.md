# Programming Languages

**Syntax:** Set of rules governing the form of allowed expressions in a programming language.

**Grammar:** Formal description of how to generate expressions by substitution.

**Non-Terminal Symbols:** Symbols that **can be substituted**, also known as *syntactic variables*.  A grammar includes a start symbol, which is a designated member from the set of non-terminal symbols from which all strings in the language may be derived by sucessive applications of production rules.

**Terminal Symbol:** Literal symbols that may appear in the outputs of the production rules of a grammar and **cannot be futher changed** by applying the rules of the grammar.

Consider a simple grammar defined by two rules:

1. The symbol $\daleth$ can become $\beth \alef$
2. The symbol $\daleth$ can become $\beth$

Here $\daleth$ is a non-terminal symbol because it has two grammar rules that can change it.  Meanwhile, $\beth$ is a terminal symbol since there is no rule that can change it into something else.

> The language defined by a grammar is precisely the set of terminal strings that can be derived by applying the rules of the grammar recusively to a source string.

An expression is **syntactically valid** $\iff$ it can be generated by the language's grammar.
